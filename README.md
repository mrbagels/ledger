Ledger is an agent-first CLI and TypeScript library for keeping implementation
history, backlog, durable decisions, release notes, verification records,
invariants, docs impact, and merge-conflict guidance inside your repository.

The primary design target is coding agents: compact retrieval, MCP tools,
conflict guidance, docs impact checks, and durable handoff records that survive
between sessions. Human use is fully supported through the CLI and generated
reader, but the structure is intentionally optimized so agents can read, query,
and act on the history without guessing from Git alone.

The source of truth is plain Markdown under `.ledger/`. Generated indexes,
reports, release notes, and a static reader make those records useful for
automation without making the project dependent on a hosted service.

## At A Glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is it? | A structured change memory layer for software repos. |
| Primary audience | Coding agents that need durable implementation memory. |
| Human workflow | Fully available through the CLI, Markdown records, reports, and static reader. |
| Source format | Markdown with YAML frontmatter. |
| Default root | `.ledger/` |
| Runtime | Node >=20 |
| Outputs | JSON indexes, validation reports, docs reports, release records, static HTML. |
| Product boundary | Ledger stands alone. It can later export into Dossier or other renderers. |

## Why Ledger Exists

Traditional changelogs answer what shipped. Ledger answers what future
maintainers and agents need before changing the code again:

- what changed
- why the change exists
- which files, symbols, docs, decisions, and backlog items are related
- what invariants must survive future refactors
- what verification proved the behavior
- what to preserve if the same area conflicts during a merge
- which release carried the work

Git history tells you what happened. Ledger tells you what matters.

## Five Minute Start

### Work From This Repo Today

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrbagels/ledger.git
cd ledger
npm ci
npm run build
npm link

ledger version
```

You can also run the CLI without linking:

```bash
node dist/cli.js version
```

### Initialize Ledger In A Project

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
ledger init --with-docs
```

This creates:

```txt
.ledger/
  config.yaml
  entries/
  backlog/
  decisions/
  releases/
  templates/
  policies/

docs/
  README.md
  llm/
```

### Record A Change

```bash
git status --short
ledger new "Add provider reconnect guard" --from-diff --area runtime
```

Ledger drafts a Markdown entry with changed files, detected TypeScript or
Markdown symbols, inferred areas, docs impact prompts, and a per-file conflict
checklist.

Open the generated file, finish the narrative, then run:

```bash
ledger validate
ledger ci
```

### Build The Local Reader

```bash
ledger index
ledger render
open .ledger/dist/index.html
```

The static reader is a single offline HTML file. It gives humans and agents a
searchable, faceted view of entries, decisions, backlog, releases, invariants,
verification checks, relationships, and raw Markdown source.

### Published Package Shape

Once published to npm, the intended install flow is:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ledger
npx ledger init --with-docs
npx ledger ci
```

Until then, use the source checkout or a local package link.

## What Ledger Creates

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.ledger/entries/` | Landed change records. |
| `.ledger/backlog/` | Accepted or proposed future work. |
| `.ledger/decisions/` | Durable project decisions. |
| `.ledger/releases/` | Release records generated from entries or maintained by hand. |
| `.ledger/templates/` | Project-local templates for new records. |
| `.ledger/policies/` | Policy files such as git coverage requirements. |
| `.ledger/indexes/` | Generated JSON indexes. |
| `.ledger/reports/` | Validation, docs, coverage, and impact reports. |
| `.ledger/dist/` | Generated static reader output. |
| `docs/` | Optional durable project docs scaffold managed alongside Ledger records. |

## Command Map

| Command | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `ledger init --with-docs` | Creates `.ledger/` and optional `docs/` scaffolding. |
| `ledger new "Title" --from-diff` | Drafts a change entry from git status. |
| `ledger validate` | Parses and validates Ledger source documents. |
| `ledger index` | Writes JSON indexes under `.ledger/indexes/`. |
| `ledger verify-integrity` | Writes record and catalog hashes for provenance checks. |
| `ledger render` | Builds the static HTML reader. |
| `ledger coverage` | Checks that changed source paths have Ledger coverage. |
| `ledger docs audit` | Finds missing and unreferenced durable docs links. |
| `ledger docs classify <path>` | Classifies docs as durable, routing, scratch, generated, or unknown. |
| `ledger docs impact --check` | Fails when source changes lack docs impact. |
| `ledger docs reconcile` | Regenerates the docs routing manifest and `START_HERE.md` from the docs audit. |
| `ledger docs migrate` | Writes a docs migration report with cleanup guidance. |
| `ledger explain <path>` | Shows records related to a file. |
| `ledger explain <path> --agent` | Emits compact agent context for a file. |
| `ledger packet <path> --write-report` | Builds a compact agent handoff packet, optionally writing `.ledger/reports/packet.md`. |
| `ledger mcp` | Starts a stdio MCP server for agent tools. |
| `ledger conflict <path> --write-report` | Extracts conflict rules, invariants, and verification, optionally writing `.ledger/reports/conflict.md`. |
| `ledger query --kind change --area cli --symbol run --text retry` | Filters records by kind, area, status, release, relationship, symbol, file, doc, id, or metadata text. |
| `ledger unreleased` | Lists landed or shipped changes not assigned to a release. |
| `ledger release v0.1.1 --include-unreleased --assign --status released --write` | Assigns selected entries and writes a release record. |
| `ledger ci` | Runs validation, docs audit, coverage, and docs impact together. |

Every command has focused help:

```bash
ledger help
ledger help new
ledger docs impact --help
ledger release --help
```

# 0020: Overhaul README And Prepare Patch Release

## Summary

Explain what changed.

## Why

Explain why it changed.

## Changed Files

### README.md

- What changed: Reworked the public project landing page.
- Anchor: `Five Minute Start`
- On conflict: Keep the README accurate for the current install state.

## Behavior And UX Impact

Explain what users experience differently.

## Invariants

- Markdown remains the source of truth.
- Generated outputs remain derived artifacts.

## Verification

- `npm run check`
- `node dist/cli.js ci`
```

## Agent Workflow

Ledger is designed to be useful to coding agents without special integration.

Before editing:

```bash
ledger explain path/to/file.ts --agent
ledger packet path/to/file.ts --write-report
ledger conflict path/to/file.ts
```

After editing:

```bash
ledger new "Describe the change" --from-diff
ledger ci
```

The entry should tell the next agent what changed, what must remain true, and
how to verify the behavior.

For MCP-capable agents, run Ledger as a stdio server:

```bash
ledger mcp
```

The server exposes tools for validation, query, file explanation, conflict
guidance, agent packets, docs impact checks, and integrity verification.

## Release Workflow

Prepare a release record from entries already assigned to a version:

```bash
ledger release v0.1.1 --status released --date 2026-06-29 --write
```

Or preview currently unreleased work without writing:

```bash
ledger release v0.1.1 --include-unreleased --status planned
```

To promote currently unreleased landed work and write the release record in one
step:

```bash
ledger release v0.1.1 --include-unreleased --assign --status released --write
```

The generated release document includes public notes, internal entry details,
verification guidance, and known issues.

## Docs Relationship

Ledger does not replace full project documentation. It replaces the scattered
implementation memory that often grows inside `docs/` without structure.

Use:

- `.ledger/` for change records, backlog, decisions, releases, invariants,
  verification, and conflict rules
- `docs/` for durable product, architecture, operations, API, guide, reference,
  and agent routing docs

Ledger can scaffold and audit `docs/`, but it does not try to become a docs CMS.
`ledger docs reconcile` keeps agent routing files current, and
`ledger docs migrate` reports scratch, generated, unknown, missing, and
unreferenced docs that may need cleanup.

## Integrity

Use `ledger verify-integrity` to generate a deterministic SHA-256 hash for every
Ledger source record plus a catalog hash for the current record set. Ledger
writes `.ledger/indexes/integrity.json` for tools and
`.ledger/reports/integrity.md` for review.

## Library Usage

The package exports the same core primitives used by the CLI:

```ts
import {
  findWorkspace,
  readLedgerDocuments,
  validateDocuments,
  buildIndexes,
  createLedgerMcpServer,
} from "ledger";

const workspace = await findWorkspace(process.cwd());
const documents = await readLedgerDocuments(workspace);
const validation = validateDocuments(workspace, documents);
const indexes = buildIndexes(workspace, documents);
const mcpServer = createLedgerMcpServer({ cwd: process.cwd() });
```

Use the library when you want to build custom dashboards, agent context
packets, release tooling, or renderer adapters.

- [Roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md)
- [Implementation Plan](./docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

## Development

Development happens on `next`. Stable releases are promoted to `master`.

```bash
npm ci
npm run ci
```

`npm run ci` runs typecheck, tests, build, Ledger's own CI checks, and an npm
package dry run.

Tagged releases use `.github/workflows/release.yml`. When `NPM_TOKEN` is set in
repository secrets, pushing `vX.Y.Z` publishes the verified package to npm with
provenance.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Product Boundary

Ledger stands on its own. It does not depend on Dossier or any renderer to be
useful. Later, a separate adapter can export Ledger's normalized model into
Dossier or another artifact system.
