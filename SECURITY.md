# Security

Please do not open public issues for security-sensitive reports. Use the
[private GitHub security advisory form](https://github.com/kylebegeman/ledger/security/advisories/new).

Send a private report to the repository owner with:

- affected version or commit
- reproduction steps
- impact
- any suggested mitigation

Ledger source records can include project paths, internal notes, and release
history. Do not commit secrets, credentials, private keys, production data, or
private customer information to Ledger records.

`ledger serve` treats rendered Ledger content as sensitive. It binds to
loopback by default, rejects non-loopback binding unless `--expose` is present,
and requires `LEDGER_SERVE_TOKEN` in network mode. Network exposure should sit
behind TLS. Generated static files carry a restrictive CSP meta policy, but a
third-party static host remains responsible for transport security and response
headers.

Use `ledger render --profile public` when preparing an externally hosted reader.
This profile only selects released release records and strips internal source,
paths, relationships, validation findings, invariants, and verification details.
It is a data-minimization control, not an access-control layer. Review the
explicit `Public Notes` content before publication.

Supported releases require maintained Node.js LTS lines. CI tests Node 22 and
Node 24 on Linux, macOS, and Windows, audits production dependencies, and
installs the packed artifact before release. GitHub Actions are pinned to exact
commits and updated through Dependabot.
